									Shyju Gurukkal is a 4th generation practitioner of the traditional martial art form of Kalaripayattu and the ancient healing art of
									Ayurveda Marma Kalari Chikitsa.
									<br />
									<br />
									Hailing from a lineage deeply rooted in the art of Kalaripayattu, Guru Shyju proudly follows in the footsteps of his father, Sri
									Shanmukan Gurukkal, a renowned Guru and mentor, who instilled in him a profound passion for Kalaripayattu. Growing up in this
									martial heritage, Shyju Gurukkal imbibed not only the physical aspects but also the rich cultural and philosophical underpinnings
									that make Kalaripayattu an extraordinary art form.
									<br />
									<br />
									<span className="font-bold">Training and Achievements:</span> Shyju Gurukkal's journey into the world of Kalaripayattu began at the
									tender age of 5, right in the nurturing environment of his own home. His father, Sri Shanmukan Gurukkal, started grooming him as
									his disciple, kindling a lifelong dedication to this ancient art. At the age of 6 1/2, he entered the competitive arena,
									participating in his first Championship.
									<br />
									<br />
									As he grew older, he had the privilege to learn from other revered Gurus who were close friends of his father and other Gurus such
									as <br />
									Sri Damodaran Gurukkal, <br />
									Sri Mustafa Gurukkal <br />
									Sri Chandran Gurukkal <br />
									Sri Hassan Gurukkal <br />
									Sri Kumaran Nayar Ashan <br />
									Sri Kuttiammakkutty Ustad <br />
									Sri Vinod Gurukkal <br />
									Sri Veerashoor Perumal <br />
									Sri Krishnan Nayar Gurukkal. <br />
									<br />
									His dedication and hard work bore fruit when he was acknowledged as an A-grade Guru by the Kerala Kalari Payattu Association-Kerala
									State Sports Council in 2010, a recognition for his exceptional teaching abilities and contribution to Kalaripayattu. He has been
									an integral part of various national and international events, such as the Commonwealth Games and National Games, where he
									showcased the profound essence of Kalaripayattu.
									<br />
									<br />
									<span className="font-bold">A Visionary Performer:</span> Shyju Gurukkal's artistic vision for Kalaripayattu extends beyond
									conventional boundaries. As the brainchild of Shyju Gurukkal, presenting Kalaripayattu theatrically is a novel concept that he
									introduced to the world. Departing from the traditional format where a few Kalari practitioners exhibit some Kalari moves, Shyju
									Gurukkal ventured into the realm of theatrical Kalaripayattu performances with the groundbreaking presentation "Puranjay" in 2014,
									and since then, there has been no looking back. His subsequent productions, including "Sadgamaya" in 2016, "Chadulam" in 2018, and
									"Moksha" in 2020, have captivated audiences with their uniqueness and creativity, offering an unparalleled presentation of
									Kalaripayattu blended with the immersive experience of theatre.
									<br />
									<br />
									<span className="font-bold">Teaching Legacy:</span> Shyju Gurukkal is an ardent teacher, dedicated to imparting the knowledge of
									Kalaripayattu to the next generation. At 17, his father entrusted him with the responsibility of managing VPS Kalari. His teaching
									style is deeply rooted in the traditional Gurukul system, focusing on not just the physical techniques but also nurturing the
									mental and spiritual growth of his students. Under his tutelage, students from all walks of life, ranging from 3 to 60 years of
									age, find a transformative journey through Kalaripayattu building stamina, flexibility and confidence.
									<br />
									<br />
									<span className="font-bold">Nurturing Warriors:</span> With unwavering dedication, Shyju Gurukkal expanded VPS Kalari's reach by
									establishing branches in various regions across Kerala and Karnataka. These branches have become centres of excellence, offering
									aspiring learners the opportunity to experience the true heritage of Kalaripayattu.
									<br />
									<br />
									<span className="font-bold">A Global Ambassador:</span> His dedication to spreading the essence of Kalaripayattu has taken him to
									various corners of the world, where he has been an integral part of tourism programs, presenting Kalaripayattu to international
									audiences. His performances in places like Dubai, Sharjah, and several states within India have received appreciation and applause.
									<br />
									<br />
									<span className="font-bold">Contributions and Recognition:</span> Shyju Gurukkal's dedication to Kalaripayattu led him to acquire
									certified expertise in Massage and Therapeutic techniques in 2006. The following years saw him participating and presenting
									Kalaripayattu in prestigious events such as the Commonwealth Games, National Games, and various state-level programs. In 2010, he
									was honoured to be selected as an A-grade Guru by the Kerala Kalari Payattu Association (Kerala State Sports Council), recognising
									his exceptional teaching abilities. The Kerala Sports Council also acknowledged his significant contribution to Kalaripayattu in
									2013.
									<br />
									<br />
									Shyju Gurukkal's remarkable journey as a 4th generation practitioner of Kalaripayattu and Ayurveda Marma Kalari Chikitsa has not
									only enriched his life but has also bestowed upon him the privilege to share the invaluable knowledge and essence of these ancient
									arts with countless students, both locally and globally. As a visionary performer and passionate teacher, he continues to inspire
									and nurture the warriors of tomorrow through VPS Kalari, preserving and promoting the legacy of this extraordinary traditional
									martial art form.
